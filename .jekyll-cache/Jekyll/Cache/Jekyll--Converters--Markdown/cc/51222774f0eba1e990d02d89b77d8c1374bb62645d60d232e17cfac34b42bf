I"±<p>Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I study auditory neuroscience in <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/hearing/">Maria Geffen</a>â€™s lab. My thesis work uses a combination of chronic electrophysiology, behavior, and optogenetics to examines how efficient neural codes in the brain impact our ability to hear sounds. In my free time, I make <a href="http://localhost:4000//art">art</a>, <a href="http://localhost:4000//beer">beer</a> and ride/work on bikes.</p>
