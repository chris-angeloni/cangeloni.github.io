I am a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I study auditory neuroscience in the lab of [Dr. Maria Geffen](https://www.med.upenn.edu/hearing/). My research focuses on the mouse auditory system, where I am interested in how activity in the brain drives auditory behaviors. To do this, I use a combination of behavior, chronic recordings of neural populations, optogenetics and computational models.
